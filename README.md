## Exercises
There are 8 sets of exercises and each has 8 exercises within it.
They are all in the executale created by this project but they won't all run until they are implemented.
So if you try to run a command and it just prints out help and nothing else, it isn't implemented yet.

## Your own fresh start
The tag `v0.0.0` has been used to tag the start of this repo in a state where all the commands compile and run with just help output.
This makes it easy to have all the structure in place to make it easy to be up and running with your own implementation.

## Other Tags
Other tags will follow the conventions of `v0.[Set #].[Exercise 0-7]` until all challenges are completed and then a `v1.0.0` will be tagged.
